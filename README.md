# meteoForBike
Android app that displays the rain forecast over the next hour ( minute by minute ) along your ride.
The goal is to have a very fact and simple transparent application for preparing your ride.
For now, limited to Paris and its suburban. 

## Features to come:
- Extend the coverage with sqllite to cover 75% of the french population.
- Geolocation without gps to determine the start location.
- Add details by minutes 
- Add a satellite view around the path. 
- Add for paris and idf : ratp traffic, sytadin, velib station status. 

**Note:** This project was originally forked from https://github.com/caarmen/MeteoFranceDemo.git and powered by meteo-france and nominatim.openstreetmap.
